# Calculation-of-the-determinant-of-the-matrix-parallel

Accepts 4 parameters during startup
Input file name, output file name, implementation method and number of threads


Accepts a file as input in the first line of which the size of the matrix is indicated and then the matrix itself
Example:
4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 1 2 3
4 5 6 7

the output will be a file with the determinant
